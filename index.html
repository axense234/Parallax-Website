        <p class="snap">
          London is the capital and largest city of England and the United
          Kingdom. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the
          head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been
          a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its
          ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as
          Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note
          1][10] Since the 19th century,[11] "London" has also referred to the
          metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties
          of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which
          largely comprises Greater London,[13] governed by the Greater London
          Authority.[note 2][14] The City of Westminster, to the west of the
          City of London, has for centuries held the national government and
          parliament.
